X10Sl7-F


NOTE: Only supports 32GB


The X10SL7-F is an extremely popular model, as it includes an
LSI/Avago SAS2308 SAS2 controller onboard, for less than the
price of an LSI/Avago SAS2008 or SAS2308-based HBA.  It supports
a total of 14 drives directly attached.  As a cost tradeoff, it
uses the cheaper C222 PCH, but most users find this downgrade
acceptable given the excellent value provided by the board.
